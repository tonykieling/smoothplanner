# Travel App - Smooth Planner

# Project Description
There are lots of decisions to be made while planning a trip - where to stay, which transportation option to use, what activities to do at the destination etc
Our app aims to simplify travelling and alleviate some of the stress associated with it.
- It simplifies planning by allowing users to save all details connected to trip at one location. 
- It simplifies travelling by allowing users to view the planned itinerary day-by-day during their travel

# Target Audience
The app will be useful for business or leisure travellers looking for a simple way to organise their itineraries.
